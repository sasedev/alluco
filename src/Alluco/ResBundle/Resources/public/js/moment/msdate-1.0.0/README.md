## About OLE Automation Dates

An OLE Automation date, or "MSDate" as we call it, is implemented as a floating-point number whose integral component is the number of days before or after midnight, 30 December 1899, and whose fractional component represents the time on that day divided by 24. For example, midnight, 31 December 1899 is represented by 1.0; 6 A.M., 1 January 1900 is represented by 2.25; midnight, 29 December 1899 is represented by -1.0; and 6 A.M., 29 December 1899 is represented by -1.25.

## Usage

### toOADate()

Convert a `moment` to an OA date:

`moment().toOADate();`

This API returns a floating-point number (the OA date), so once the conversion has been made, you no longer have a `moment` object.

### fromOADate()

Convert an OA date to a `moment` (or to a JavaScript date):

`moment.fromOADate(41493)` returns `Wed Aug 07 2013 00:00:00 GMT-0600 (MDT)`

For exact date _and_ time (time is the value right of the decimal):

`moment.fromOADate(41493.706892280097000)` returns `Wed Aug 07 2013 16:57:55 GMT-0600 (MDT)`

For Moment formatting:

```
//convert OA date into Moment (JavaScript date)
var momentDate = moment.fromOADate(41493.706892280097000);

//use Moment's awesomeness
var formattedDate = momentDate.format('MMM Do YY);

//formattedDate === "Aug 7th 13"
```

This could easily be chained together as:

`moment.fromOADate(41493.706892280097000).format('MMM Do YY); //Aug 7th 13`

**Note**: OLE Automation dates are unspecified, meaning theyâ€™re based on the local timezone by default.
